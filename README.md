# Some Facts about the Kilonova
At the centre of the explosion is a stellar corpse: a neutron star. The material from this star is extremely dense (a tea cup full of this matter would weigh as much on Earth as the whole of Mount Everest). Neutron stars can be found alone or in double systems, with one star orbiting around another. The waltz lasts billions of years, but over time the stars come closer and closer together. When they finally collide, both their extreme density and their velocity (one-third the speed of light) produce the largest known explosion in the universe: a kilonova.
